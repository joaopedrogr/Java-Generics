# Java Generics

## 📘 Description
The Java-Generics repository provides an in-depth exploration of generics in Java. This repository is ideal for developers who want to master Java's generics capabilities through practical examples and exercises.

Key topics covered:

- Generic Classes: Learn how to create and use generic classes.
- Bounded Type Parameters: Understand how to restrict types in generics.
- Wildcards in Generics: Explore ? for flexible type handling.
- Generic Methods and Utilities: Work with generic methods for reusable and type-safe code.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
The project is organized for easy learning and experimentation:

### Main Files
### src/
This folder contains Java source code covering key generics concepts:

- Caixa.java: A generic class representing a storage box.
- CaixaInt.java: A specialized version of Caixa for integers.
- CaixaIntTeste.java: Test cases for CaixaInt.
- CaixaNumero.java: A generic class restricted to Number types.
- CaixaNumeroTeste.java: Testing the behavior of CaixaNumero.
- CaixaObjeto.java: A non-generic version using Object instead.
- CaixaObjetoTeste.java: Demonstrates the limitations of raw types.
- CaixaTeste.java: General test cases for the Caixa class.

### Utility and Comparisons
- ComparableTeste.java: Demonstrates the usage of Comparable with generics.
- ListaUtil.java: Implements generic utility methods for list handling.
- ListaUtilTeste.java: Tests utility methods for generic lists.
- Par.java: A generic key-value pair implementation.
- Pares.java: A collection of key-value pairs with generics.
- ParesTeste.java: Tests the Pares class with various types.
